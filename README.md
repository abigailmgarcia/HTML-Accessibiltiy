# HTML-Accessibility

## Description

This project was refactored so that it follows accessibiltiy standards and is optimized for user experience. It is now easier to view for people with disabilities, there are alt attributes for image discription, sections that proivide what is the main content of the page and so forth. While refactoring this code I learned the importance of why accessibilty is needed in a webpage and that it brings a better user experience to whoever is viewing the webpage/application.
